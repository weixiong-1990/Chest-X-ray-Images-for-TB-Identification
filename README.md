# Tuberculosis-Identification-via-Chest-X-ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning
This repository covers jupyter notebooks and presentation slides for the final project of CS5242. This project investigated different approaches of applying CNN including transfer learning, image segmentation, mask generation, image dilation and feature extraction to improve X-ray image classification.
Data source of this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilpandey360/chest-xray-masks-and-labels
